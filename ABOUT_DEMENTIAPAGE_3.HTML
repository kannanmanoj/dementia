             <p class="par">Dementia refers to a group of illnesses that eventually cause problems with thinking, memory, and daily activities. Although it is more commonly accepted in older adults, not everyone will develop it as they get older.<b style="background: burlywood;">Age, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, lack of actual work, social isolation, and discouragement are risk factors</b>. Diseases that destroy nerve cells and damage the mind cause dementia, which causes mental decline above and beyond the effects of normal aging. It affects patients' and parents' and families' and society's financial, social, mental, and physical viewpoints. Lack of awareness and trying to solve problems leads to shame and hinders willpower and compassion.</p>

                            <b style="background:burlywood;">Three stages of dementia - gentle, moderate, and serious, have not been updated recently.</b> At every stage, there are unavoidable psychological and social side effects that vary in their actual complexity and level of care needed. Mild dementia is considered independent of daily living and requires little assistance. Care is necessary for moderate dementia, especially when it comes to mind flights, dreams, and agitated behavior. Though it usually results in wheelchair dependence or a laid-up state, severe dementia involves less agitation. Designed in 1990, the Memory Facility at the Public College Emergency Clinic in Singapore uses the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale to assess the severity of dementia. Individuals with vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease are frequently referred to the center. Due to its status as a tertiary reference place, the facility primarily serves well-educated, working-class families. Alzheimer's disease is concluded using normalized models that do not include neuro-obsessive affirmation. The mean duration of the mild stage was 5.6 years, the moderate stage was 3.5 years, and the severe stage was 3.2 years among the 77 cases of Alzheimer's disease that were considered

                                Different neurodegenerative problems and elements contribute to the improvement of dementia through a moderate and irreversible loss of neurons and brain function. Presently, there is no solution for dementia. <BR></BR><b style="font-size: 25px;background:#139fe0; color: white;">There are several types of dementia.</b> <br><br>The most common type in older, more established adults is <b>Alzheimer's disease(A)</b>. It is caused by alterations in the brain, such as odd developments in tau tangles and amyloid plaques, two types of proteins. People over 60 are typically affected by <b>frontotemporal dementia(C)</b>, an uncommon form of dementia. It has to do with abnormally high or low concentrations of the proteins tau and TDP-43. Dementia caused by anomalous alpha-synuclein protein accumulations known as Lewy bodies is known as <b>Lewy body dementia(B).</b> Dementia that damages the veins in the brain or obstructs the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain is known as <b>(D)vascular dementia</b>.

                                        Individuals with vascular dementia, can stop additional brain damage by controlling their heart rate and cholesterol. Side effect management is another benefit of some drugs, such as memantine and donepezil. When treating severe depressive side effects, SSRIs might be beneficial, but they should not be the first choice. Medication like risperidone and haloperidol should only be used in extreme cases due to the potential risks involved. People with dementia can benefit from self-care strategies such as maintaining an active lifestyle, eating a balanced diet, abstaining from tobacco and alcohol, scheduling regular checkups, scheduling activities outside of work, socializing, and making decisions in advance. Caring for someone else can be difficult, so guardians should ask for help when needed. Take regular breaks, observe crucial guidelines, like taking care of yourself, and get professional help when required.Dementia patients and their guardians should prioritize taking care of themselves and getting help when they need it.

Ten million new cases are reported annually. Dementia is a leading cause of dependency and incapacity in older adults globally. Both dementia patients and their families, who offer the majority of support and care, frequently struggle with overwhelming emotions. Unfortunately, dementia is often misdiagnosed and treated with difficulty due to its lack of mindfulness and resulting stigma. The effects of dementia on caregivers, families, and society at large can be financial, social, psychological, and physical
